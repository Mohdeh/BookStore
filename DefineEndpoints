After identifying the BOOK resources to expose, I identify their respective locations.

REST APIs are accessible through HTTP, therefore, it is necessary to identify the URIs and the 
respective methods where the resources they expose can be accessed. 
These URIs are essentially paths, and can be contextual, such as listing all the customers of a particular book: /books/123456789/customers


Next, I associate a particular HTTP method to each one of these paths, where each method has a particular meaning.
The main four HTTP methods along with their functionalities are:

GET - Reads an existing resource
POST - Creates a new resource
PUT - Updates an existing resource
DELETE - Deletes an existing resource


For instance, creating a new book, is represented by: 
A POST on /books.
